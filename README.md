 Car service backend
==========

The idea came from home because we have two car and I want to organise that what we or the car 
mechanic(s) do with the cars. So I decided to make a project for develop my skills.

I used the following:
-------------------
- Spring Boot
- Docker
- Gradle
- JDK Correctto-20.0.2
- Swagger

## How to run this project

1) Firstly you need to run the **docker-compose.yml** file. This will create a docker container
with the database 
2) Then you can run the **CarservicebookApplication.java** 

***Please note that the database is empty, so you need to put some data in it!***

You can easily add data to the database with ***Swagger***.

Use this for access the endpoints: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/
